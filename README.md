## 📊 Key Visual Insights

### Contract Type Patterns:
- **Month-to-month contracts** show significantly higher churn rates
- **Longer-term contracts** (One year, Two year) demonstrate better retention
- Clear correlation between contract commitment and customer loyalty

### Gender Demographics:
- **Balanced customer base** between male and female customers
- **Similar churn patterns** across genders with slight variations
- **Total customer distribution** provides insights for targeted marketing

### Tenure Analysis:
- **Critical first 3 years** identified as highest churn risk period
- **Sharp decline** in churn after initial tenure period
- **80%+ of total churn** occurs within the first 3 years of service
