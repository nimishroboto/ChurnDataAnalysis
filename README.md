# Customer Churn Analysis for Mobile Network Services

## üìã Project Overview

This project provides comprehensive customer churn analysis for a mobile data/network services company. The analysis delivers actionable insights on customer demographics, plan suitability, and retention strategies to help optimize business decisions and reduce customer churn.

### Business Objectives
- Analyze customer demographics and age dynamics
- Identify optimal plans for different customer segments
- Understand churn patterns and high-risk customer groups
- Provide data-driven recommendations for customer retention
- Create compelling visualizations for stakeholder presentations

## üìä Dataset Information

- **Source**: Kaggle Dataset
- **Size**: 7,000+ customer records
- **Type**: Customer churn data for telecommunications/mobile services

## üìä Key Visual Insights

### Contract Type Patterns:
- **Month-to-month contracts** show significantly higher churn rates
- **Longer-term contracts** (One year, Two year) demonstrate better retention
- Clear correlation between contract commitment and customer loyalty

### Gender Demographics:
- **Balanced customer base** between male and female customers
- **Similar churn patterns** across genders with slight variations
- **Total customer distribution** provides insights for targeted marketing

### Tenure Analysis:
- **Critical first 3 years** identified as highest churn risk period
- **Sharp decline** in churn after initial tenure period
- **80%+ of total churn** occurs within the first 3 years of service
